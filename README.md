# LibConnect

LibConnect is a react web application which facilitates easy library management incuding the issuance of books.
# IMPORTANT
I tried hosting the site but it was extremely buggy. So, I would really appreciate it if you ran it locally.</br>
1. Firstly, either download my repo or clone it into your device.
2. Then, in the terminal, change directory to the libconnect folder. ```cd libconnect\``` Please make sure this is the **libconnect** folder which is in the same level as the **screenshots** folder.
3. Now, run the command ```npm i```. This should generate the **node_modules** folder (Might take a minute).
4. Finally, enter the command ```npm start```. This should start hosting the website locally in your default browser. :)

As ```firebase``` doesn't let users sign in with username, my website uses sign in with email and password ( and sign in with google).  Also, ```firebase``` doesn't let users set a password with less than 6 characters. So, I did not follow the user log in info mentioned in the recruitment pdf.

There are 6 accounts already registered: 
```
email: admin@libconnect.com
password: admin123
```
```
email: user1@libconnect.com
password: password1
```
```
email: user2@libconnect.com
password: password2
```
```
email: user3@libconnect.com
password: password3
```
```
email: user4@libconnect.com
password: password4
```
```
email: user5@libconnect.com
password: password5
```
```admin@libconnect.com``` is an admin. All other users are initially set as members.
